Language Types

	Interpreted vs Compiled

		Interpreted language code is turned directly into machine instructions via another program (the interpreter). The interpreter must be used every time. Examples: Python, Netlogo, Racket

		Compiled code must be translated into machine (binary) code via anotheer program (the compiler). The machine code can then be run by a computer. The compulerer only needs to be rurn once. Examples: Java, C, Pascal, C#, Objective-C, C++

	Functional vs Object Oriented

		In a functional language your main programming task is to write functions which are then executed in order. Examples: Racket, Python, Netlogo, C

		In Object Oriented Programming (OOP), your main programming task is to create classes of objects and have objects interact with each other. Examples: Java, C++, Objective-C

Aim: What should be in our java toolbox?

Do Now: What command line commands would do the following?
	(assume you are starting at your home directory)
	1) Move foo.py from Desktop/ to Documents/
		mv Desktop/foo.py Documents/
		[note: cp would copy the same way mv moves]
	2) Remove all .class files
		rm *.class
		[note: rm f*.class is a function that removes all files that start with f and end with .class]
	3) Figure out what javac does
		[note: man <command> is a function that explains how the function is used, use q to quit]
		javac is the java compiler
	4) Connect to homer.stuy.edu from someplace else
		ssh james.chin@homer.stuy.edu
		[note: syntax for ssh is ssh <username>@<location>, this is followed by a prompt for a password]
	5) Copy woohoo.java from your home directory on lisa.stuy.edu to a code/ directory on your own machine
		scp james.chin@homer.stuy.edu:woohoo.java code/
		[note: scp stands for secure copy, syntax for scp is scp <username>@<location> <location on local machine>, order can be reversed]

Aim: What should be in our java toolbox?

Programming Tools
	Text Editor
		Basic tool for writing code.
		Programming text editors will have many useful programming features, like syntax highlighting, automatic tabbing, autocompletion, etc.
	Compiler
	Interpreter
	IDE
		Integrated Development Environment
		Designed to handle all your programming needs.
		IDEs will contain a text editor as well as an interpreter/compiler for the language
		IDEs are language specific

Java Tools
	javac
		The Java compiler
		Basic operation:
			$ javac <java source>
			$ javac foo.java
				Will create foo.class
	java
		The Java virtual machine (JVM)
		TheJVM allows your compiled java code torurnon any computer that has java. This is called being cross-platform.
		Each platform (computer + hardware + OS) hasa specific JVM
		The JVM that sits between your compiled java files andyour computer hardware, allowing any java compiled file to run on any computer
		
		Basic operation
			$ java <java binay>
			$ java foo
				Will only work if foo.class exists

9/11/14
Aim: What does a java program look like?

Do Now: Write a simple program that prints a message to the screen in python. If you don't know python, someone near you should, find out who and talk to them.
	print "hello, world"
	
	Terminal commands
		emacs
		emacs -nw
			opens terminal version of emacs
		emacs <filename> -nw
			opens file in emacs
		fg
			brings emacs back from background to the foreground

	Emacs Commands
		C stands for CTRL
		C-x-c		exit ("c" stands for "close")
		C-x-s		save
		C-x-w		save as
		C-x-f		open ("f" stands for "find")
		C-g			stops an emacs action
		C-e			go to end of line
		C-a			go to start of line
		C-s			search
		C-k			cut a line ("k" stands for "kill", putting the line in the "kill ring")
		C-y			paste a line ("y" stands for "yank", yanking it out of the "kill ring")
		C-z			puts emacs in the background
		
	public class Hello {
		public static void main(String[] args) {
			System.out.println("hello, world");
		}
	}
	
9/12/14
Aim: What does a java program look like?

Do Now: Log in, open a terminal and use emacs to write the simple java program we say at the end of class yesterday. Then try to compile and rurn it!

In case you missed it:

	public class Hello {
		public static void main(String[] args) {
			System.out.println("hello, world");
		}
	}
	
	[note: thingy after "class" must have the same name as the file because of confusing things]
	
Java Syntax Basics:
	Java is case sensitive!
	
	The class name must match the file name
		ex. Hello.java must define a class called Hello
		
	Regular statements must end in a ;
	
	Code blocks are containted inside {}
		{ replaces ; at the end of a line that starts a code block
		
		} sets the end of the code block
		
		Examples of code blocks
			Method bodies
			Class bodies
			Conditional (if, else...) statement results
			Looping processes
	Comments
		// can be used to comment a single line
			ex.	//This will print to the command line
				System.out.println("boo"); //scary
		/* .. */ can be used to comment multiple lines
			ex.	/*	This is the Hello class,
					it is designed to greet the 
					user with a pleasant message. */	

9/16/14 - Minutia
Aim: What's all this about objects now?

Do Now: Imagine a generic teacher, think about all the properties of a teacher, write them down and break them into 2 categories:
	1) Things the teacher does
		teach
		Ruojia - give students a lot of homework
		grade and create tests
		Mike - breathe
		Helen - teach and communicate
		Sophia - determine your future
		Julia - tell great(bad) jokes
		Roy - randomly mention things from their past
		Roz - ask questions
	2) Things the teacher knows
		Gary - the subject they are teaching
		Aaron - things about all the students
		Jeffrey - English
		Jerry - printer status
	
[minutia-note: CJ Dojo opens today]
[minutia-note: Textbook are available tomorrow and Thursday during the CS Dojo]
[minutia-note: See DW after 10th if you don't know your password]
	
[minutia-note: DW tried to tell us about analog feedback again]

Object Oriented Programming (OOP)	

	An OOP program is a collection of objects
	
	The properties of an object are defined in a class
	
		A Class is a blueprint for all objects of the same type
		
		An object is a specific instance of a class
		
		An object has 2 parts
		
			1) Instance Variables : Things the object "knows"
			2) Methods: Things the object "does" [note: this is like a function]
			
		Instance Variables are declared at the top of a class, before any methods
		
			You must declare any variables before you use it.
			Variable delcaration includes a name and type.
			
9/17/14
Aim: What are the parts of a java class?

Do Now: Create a new java file that contains the following:

public class Greenter {

	//Instance Variables
	private String message;
	
	//Methods
	public void setMessage( String m ) {
		message = m;
	}
	
	public void greet() {
		System.out.println( message );
	}
}

Java Class Anatomy

	Protection
		Access to classes, variables andmethods is determined by their protection
		
		There are three kinds of protection:
			public
				Can be used by any java class
				
			private
				Can only be used by the class itself
				
			protected
				Can be used by the class itself and all subclasses
				
		Identifiers
			class, method and variable names are called Identifiers
			
			Can only be made of letters (upper and lower case), numbers, _ and $
			
			Cannot start with a number
			
		Template java class
			<class header> {
			
				<instance variables>
				
				<methods>
			}
			
			class header
				<protection> class <classname>
				
				classname
					By convention, class names start with a capital letter and use camel case
						ex:	Greeter
							MyAwesomeClass
				
			instance variables
				<protection> <type> <name>
				
				name
					By convention, variable names start with a lower case letter and use camel case
						ex:	x
							myString
							
				[note: Continued from 9/17/14 on 9/18/14]
				
				type
					All variables must have an associated type
					
					Thetype can either be a primitive datatype (like int) or any java class
					
						ex.	x;
							Greeter g;
			method header
				<protection> <return type> <name>(<parameters>)
				
				name
					Like variable names, method names usually start with a lower case letter and use camel case
				
				parameters
					Parameters must be given a type and a name like any other variable
					
					Multiple parameters are separated by ,
					
					ex: (int x, int y, String s)
				
				return type
					If a method returns a value, you must declare what kind of value is returned
					
					If a method does not return a value, then the return type should be void
					
				Two or more methods in the same class can have the same name as long as they do not have the same parameters.
				This is known as OVERLOADING methods
				
					public int foo()
					public int foo(String s)
						foo() is overloaded correctly
						
		main method
			Each class can (but doesn't have to) contain a method called main
			
			main is special, it is the only method that is run automatically
			
				$ java Hello
				will run the main method inside the class Hello
				
			The main method must have the following header:
				public static void main(String[] args)
				
			[note: Continued from 9/18/14 on 9/19/14]
	
				static is a spcial keyword that modifies how a method works.
				
Creating Objects
	In order to create an object (instance of a class), you must call a special method known as the CONSTRUCTOR
	
	By default, all java classes have at least 1 constructor
	
	The name of a contructor is always the name of the class itself
	
	In order to use the contructor, you must use the keyword "new"

9/18/14
Aim: What are parts of a java class (part II)?

Do Now: Open up the Greeter class file from yesterday

9/22/14
Aim: What are the Java primitive data types?

Do Now: List the different types of data you have worked with programming in other languages.

Datatypes
	Lists
	Dictionaries
	Floating points
	Boolean
	Integers
	Strings
	Character

Using Variables
	Creating and using a variable takes two steps, declaration and initiation
	
Declaring a variable states what kind of type it is
		ex. 	int x;
			String s;
			Greeter g;
	
	Initialization gives a variable an initial value
		ex:	x = -24;
			s = “Hello”;
			g = new Greeter();

	Declaration and initialization can be done on a single line
		ex:	int x = -24;
			String s = “Hello”;
			Greeter g = new Greeter();
Primitive Data Types
	The only data types that are not classes

	Type		Name		Size(bits)	Range
	Integers	byte		8		[-128,	127]
				short		16		[-2^15,	2^15 - 1]	
				int			32		[-2^31,	2^31 - 1]
				long		64		[-2^63, 2^63 - 1]
	
Floating		float		32		7 digits of precision
	points		double		64		14 digits of precision
	
	Character	char		16
	Boolean		boolean		?		True or False

9/23/14
Aim: How do we write our own constructors?

Do Now: What is the smallest variable type that could be used to store the following values

	1) 5				byte
	2) -30,000			short
	3) 255				short
	4) 5,000,000,000	long
	
Default Values
	If a variable is not initialized it is given a default value.
	
	All numeric primitives are set to 0
	
	Boolean primitives are set to false
	
	Characters are set to '' (empty/null character)
	[note: 'a' is character, "a" is a string]
	
	Strings are set to null
	
	All object variables are set to null (nothing)
	
Constructor
	Java creates a default constructor for every class
	
		The default constructor takes no parameters and will set all instance variables to their default values
		
	You can write your own constructors using this header:
	
		<protection> <class name>(<parameters>)
		
	Constructors can be private or protected, but are most often public
	
	public Greeter() {
		message = "Hello";
	}
	
	public Greeter( String m ) {
		message = m;
	}
	
9/29/14
Aim: How do conditional statements work in java?

Do Now: Pick a programming language (not java) and perform the following tasks

  1) Find the product of 4 and 6
  2) Find the remainder of 105 / 6
  3) Add 1 to a variable x
  
Note on operators in java
  Arithmetic operators
    +, -, *, /, %
   
      %: mod operator (remainder)
      
      Division is dependent on the types used
      
        <integer> / <integer> ==> <integer>
        
        Integer division truncates the value, no rounding occurs
        
        All other combinations will result in a floating point type
        
        11 / 2 ==> 5
        11 / 2.0 ==> 5.5
        
        +=, -=, *=, /=, %=
          Compound assignment operators
          x+= y <==> x = x + y
          
        ++, --
          Increment/decrement operators
          The same as adding/subtracting 1 to a variable
          
          int x = 4;
          x++; //x becomes 5
          
          x++ means return x and then add 1 to it
          ++x means add 1 to x and then return it 
          
  Comparison operators
    >,<,>=,<=,==,!=
      Return boolean values
      != inequality
      
  Boolean operators
    && and
    || or
    ! not
	
9/30/14
Aim: How do conditional statements work in java?

Do Now: Write a sample java program that tests the following:

	String a = new String("hello");
	String b = new String("hello");
	
	System.out.println(a);
	System.out.println(b);
	System.out.println(a == b);
	
Object comparison:
	== and != will check to see if two object variables refer to the same piece of memory, not if they have the same "value"
	
	Many classes (including String), have an equals method that can check for value equality
		ex
			String s = new String("hello");
			s.equals("hello");
			
			You cannot use >, <, >=, <= on object variables
			
Conditional Statements
	if ( <BOOLEAN> ) {
		<RESULT 1>
	}
	else if ( <BOOLEAN> ) {
		<RESULT 2>
	}
	...
	else {
		<FINAL RESULT>
	}
	
10/31/14/14
Aim: How do basic java loops work?

Do Now: Go to this website and explore
  http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/
  What have you found?
  
while loop
  
  Will run as long as a condition is true
  
  Syntax:
    while ( <BOOLEAN> ) {
      <CODE>
    }
    
  Example:
    int fact = 1;
    int n = 1;
    while ( n <= 5 ) {
      fact *= n++; //multiplies fact with n, then adds 1 to n
    }
  
for loop

  "Counting loop". Will run as long as a condition is true.
  
  Has built in initialization and update code for counter:
  
  Syntax:
    for (<INIT/*initialization*/>; <BOOLEAN>; <UPDATE>) {
      <CODE>
    }
    
  Example:
    int fact;
    for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
      fact *= i;
    }
    
  init only happens once before the loop starts repeating
  
  the condition is checked at the beginning of each "cycle"
  
  update occurs at the end of each cycle
  
10/7/14
Aim: Refining our classes

Do Now: Open up your RationalNumber class

Notes about the rational number class:
  
  Passing an object of the same type as a parameter will allow you to access the instance variables and mthods of the parameter directly:
  
    public void multiply( Rational other ) {
      numerator = numerator * other.numerator;
      denominator = denominator * other.denominator;
    }
    
    The keyword this can be used to represent the object calling the function
    
      public void multiply( Rational other ) {
        this.numerator = this.numerator * other.numerator;
        this.denominator = this.denominator * other.denominator;
      }
      //meow
      //^that was Julia
      //*sigh* says James
      //no comment says James as well
      //please do not erase
      //dot dot dot
      //...
      
10/8/14
Aim: What's up with that static thing anyway?

Do Now:
  1) Open your Rational Number class (any version is fine)
  2) Add a method called toString, it should return a string representation of the object.
  3) In main, create a Rational Number object and print out the object variable directly
  
toString
  Returns a String representation of an object. Java will automatically call toString whenever you use an object variable in a String context.
  Every class has a toString method (just like a default constructor). The default toString method will return the class name and the memory location of the object.
  toString should have the following header:
  
    public String toString();
    
  If you write your own toString, it will replace the one java creates for you

    RationalNumber r = new RationalNumber(8, 34);
    System.out.println(r); //will call r.toString();
  
static

  Static methods are class methods that are not attached to a specific object

  Static methods cannot access instance variables
  
  Static methods are run by a class and not by an object
  
    Math.sqrt(25); //poke
    //that was Julia
    //liesssss
    //dot dot dot
    //...
